The axillary nerve innervates teres minor and deltoid. It wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus and is endangered by fractures of the surgical neck. If the axillary nerve was damaged and deltoid was denervated, the patient would be unable to abduct his upper limb beyond 15 to 20 degrees.

CMV is one of the TORCH infections. The risk of serious adverse neurological outcome increases if primary infection occurs in the first half of pregnancy. When maternal infection occurs before 8 weeks of pregnancy, 80 90% of infants will have symptoms. Because of high immunization rates, congenital rubella syndrome is now very rare. If maternal chickenpox develops before 20 weeks' gestation there is a 2 3% risk of the fetus developing congenital varicella syndrome. This consists of skin scarring, eye abnormalities (cataracts, chorioretinitis, microphthalmia), hypoplasia of limbs, cortical atrophy, microcephaly, intellectual impairment, neurogenic bladder, oesophageal dilatation and early death. The correct answer is Hepatitis B because infants may become chronic carriers of HBsAg and are at risk of developing carcinoma of the liver. Symptoms of liver disease in the neonatal period are rare in affected babies and microcephaly is unlikely.

The mechanism of MH is thought to be related to uncontrolled calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle tissue.

Patients with MH typically present first with prolonged muscle spasms, raised end-tidal CO2, tachycardia and arrhythmias. As the condition progresses, hyperthermia, hyperkalaemia, haemodynamic instability and skin mottling can lead to DIC, myoglobinuria, grossly raised CK levels and eventually cardiac arrest. 

Treatment guidelines are complex for malignant hyperthermia, however, dantrolene (an antagonist of the calcium releasing channel/receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum) is considered the most important life-saving intervention. While it is important to cease inhalational anaesthetics, give fluid resuscitation, hyperventilate with 100% O2 and initiate TIVA with propofol, dantrolene will ultimately save the patient's life.

This feeds back a signal to increase sympathetic stimulation to the heart and systemic vasculature to increase contractility, heart rate and vascular resistance, all of which leads to increase in MAP.","The kidneys have detected a decrease in renal perfusion and have subsequently increased renin production, significantly increasing sodium reabsorption;;Peripheral chemoreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid body increase firing as blood pressure decreases, increasing sympathetic innervation to the heart to increase heart rate and contractility;;Endothelin released from the damage VSMC has caused systemic vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure;;The heart has sensed a decrease in ventricular pressure and has decreased production of ANP and BNP to promote water retention"

While the surviving sepsis guidelines support use of packed red cells in anaemic patients, this should occur only once patients are haemodynamically stable. Dobutamine is a beta-adrenoceptor agonist (primarily beta-1, but has some beta-2 activity) used more in cases of cardiogenic shock, and is not recommended as initial therapy in septic shock. Similarly, albumin can be used in patients with hypoalbuminaemia, but is not considered standard protocol for initial resuscitation. The patient in this question has developed a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, likely due to significant resuscitation with normal saline.

This patient appears to have been diagnosed with gallstones in the past, which predisposes her to a greater risk of biliary disease in the future. The presence of fever and jaundice indicate there is both infection and obstruction of bile flow. The condition in this context that causes this problem is ascending cholangitis, where infection begins after a stone from the gallbladder becomes lodged in the common bile duct.

( Biliary colic is the pain associated with ingestion of fatty foods, and is likely related to temporary obstruction of the cystic duct. When there is inflammation of the gallbladder (generally due to obstruction by a stone lodged in the cystic duct), this is termed cholecystitis. Because there is no obstruction to the common bile duct, there will be no jaundice. ( Gallstone ileum occurs with chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, leading to a fistula forming between the small bowel and the gallbladder. Large stones can then pass into the bowel, causing an obstruction.

HOCM can be differentiated from aortic stenosis on examination by performing the Valsalva manoeuvre. When this is done, a patient with HOCM will have a louder murmur, whereas a patient with aortic stenosis will have a softer murmur. This is because the Valsalva increases intrathoracic pressure, pushing the walls of the left ventricle together. This causes blood to flow in an even more turbulent manner through the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), which is hypertrophied in HOCM. The valsalva reduces cardiac output by reducing venous return, so there is less blood flowing through the aortic valve. As such, the Valsalva makes aortic stenosis murmurs softer.

Bulk-forming agents (psyllium, dietary fibre) are non-digestible carbohydrates that are used in long-term control of constipation. Iso-osmotic laxatives (e.g. macrogol/movicol) do not actively draw water into the gut lumen. Stool softeners (e.g. coloxyl, parachoc) provide lubrication to stool passage. Stimulant agents (e.g. senna, docusate) act on the gut mucosa and neural network to actively increase stool movement through the bowels.

While both direct and indirect inguinal hernias can pass through the superficial ring into the scrotum, indirect hernias are more likely to due to the path along the inguinal canal being of lower resistance than a muscular defect. Internally, indirect inguinal hernias pass medially to the inferior epigastric vessels, while direct inguinal hernias will pass laterally to the inferior epigastric vessels. Occlusion of the deep inguinal ring also prevents this hernia from protruding, indicating it is indirect.

IV colchicine should not be used in patients with renal failure, and therefore its use would be contraindicated in this patient.3 Similarly, indomethacin is a poor choice in this patient given his age and decreased kidney function. Although often forgotten, probenecid can be used as a uric acid lowering agent; however, it is only beneficial in patients who undersecrete uric acid (24-hour uric acid level < 800 mg) and have a creatinine clearance greater than 60 mg/dL. Allopurinol should be used with caution and at a reduced dose in patients with decreased renal function.","Obtain serum uric acid level and initiate indomethacin, colchicine and prednisolone;;Obtain serum uric acid level and initiate allopurinol;;Obtain rheumatoid factor and if positive initiate methotrexate;;Obtain microscopic examination of tissue aspirate and initiate indomethacin, colchicine and prednisolone"

The most common type of kidney stone is calcium oxalate. These stones are radio-opaque, and so can be picked up by imaging. The gold standard is a non-contrast CT. The reason no contrast is given is due to the potential for renal function compromise, which has a risk of becoming worse by giving contrast (why you always should check Creatining Clearance before giving anyone contrast). 

Radio-opaque stones could also be picked up on Abdo Xray, however, you should always consider the other types of stones that may be the cause (where a good history comes in handy - pick up on those risk factors). In reality, many doctors do an abdo x-ray first, and may be able to pick up a radio-opaque stone. But in the chance that it is a radio-lucent stone (uric acid stones), an AXR will miss this. 

The gold standard is thus a non-contrast CT.

In the collecting duct, aldosterone functions normally to increase sodium and water retention. This occurs because aldosterone leads to an increase in sodium channels on the luminal membrane of the nephron, which creates a large shift of sodium from the nephron lumen to inside the tubule cells. This shift is counteracted by a counter-shift of potassium out of the cells into the lumen of the nephron, where the potassium is subsequently excreted. Potassium-sparing diuretics inhibit this process, thus leading to retention of potassium while also promoting fluid and sodium loss.

On further questioning, you learn that John has a history of congestive cardiac failure, for which he takes spironolactone and metoprolol, as well as type 1 diabetes which requires regular insulin injections. He also takes perindopril for hypertension. A set of basic bloods are taken and an ECG is performed. He is noted to have a raised potassium of 6.4mmol/L, with peaked T waves on his ECG. Finger prick blood glucose monitoring reveal a blood sugar level of 21.2mmol/L, and mildly raised ketones.

Which of the following is LEAST likely to have caused John s hyperkalaemia?",FALSE,TRUE,Tom Garry***,General Medicine(Year 3),Congestive cardiac failure,"Of the above list of potential causes of John s hyperkalaemia, underlying congestive cardiac failure (CCF) is the least likely contributor. With CCF, the failure of the heart to pump and thus adequately perfuse the body s organs leads to renal hypoperfusion. Renal hypoperfusion results in a fall in GFR, which stimulates renin to convert angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is followed by conversion to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II causes release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which then acts on renal tubule collecting ducts to reabsorb sodium and water, while excreting potassium. Thus, CCF may lead to increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity, thus causing hypokalaemia.

Spironolactone inhibits aldosterone by acting as an antagonist at the mineralocorticoid receptor, thus revering the excretion of potassium from the kidneys. Perindopril and other ACE inhibitors may cause hyperkalaemia through decreased GFR, which is caused by preferential relaxation of the efferent arteriole. Ketoacidosis (or any acidotic state) increases serum potassium concentration through exchange of hydrogen ions with potassium ions in various cells. Acute kidney injury essentially impairs the kidney s ability to excrete potassium from the body, thus leading to accumulation and hyperkalaemia.

As many as 60 percent of these ovulations are potentially fertile. Since the first ovulation often occurs before the first menses, we educate women that return of menses cannot be used as a reliable marker for when to initiate contraception.

For breastfeeding women, the resumption of ovulation appears to be influenced by the frequency and duration of breastfeeding.

Impact of lactation   Women who exclusively breastfeed typically have a delay in resumption of ovulation postpartum due to prolactin-induced inhibition of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone release from the hypothalamus. The degree to which breastfeeding suppresses ovulation is modulated by the intensity of the breastfeeding, the basal nutritional status of the mother, and the body mass index of the mother. 

While breastfeeding is associated with subfertility, anovulation is likely only when all of the following specific conditions are met:

The long-term management of AF is either rhythm control (with DCR or anti-arrhythmics) or rate control (with anticoagulation).

If a patient has been in AF for an undefined length of time, cardioversion is contraindicated as there may be a clot in the left atrium that could dislodge with DCR. Anti-arrhythmics are usually used in young people with structurally normal hearts. Rate control with a beta-blocker (cardioselective = bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol) and anticoagulation with warfarin or a NOAC (e.g. rivaroxaban) is the mainstay treatment for the patient described above.

",FALSE,TRUE,Nicole Lancaster***,Women's Health(Year 3);;General Practice(Year 4),This is a 'missed pill'. Take your missed pill when you get home and skip the sugar pill period.  Use barrier contraception for the next 7 days. ,"There is an important distinction between a 'late pill' (<24 hours late) and a 'missed pill' (>24 hours late). For a late pill, the missed pill should be taken as soon as they remember plus their normal pill. Two or less pills within 24 hours is okay and no barrier/emergency contraception is required. 

For a missed pill, there is a '7 day rule'. 
- Active pills should always been taken for 7 days after a missed pill, even if they are due for sugar pills. Miss the sugar pills if they are near the end of the cycle.
- Barrier contraception must be used for those 7 days.
- The BEGINNING of a cycle is the most dangerous. If any of the previous 7 pills were sugar pills, they require emergency contraception. See your doctor or pharmacist.

Two doctors are called to determine the cause of death but cannot do so after 24 hours of deliberation.,"Doctors are required to inform the coroner of 'reportable' and 'reviewable' deaths.

Reviewable death- the death of the second child in a family (unless that child never left the hospital from birth). This applies to the 13-year-old boy.

Reportable deaths- there are multiple, familiarise yourself with the document below. 
The death of the 79-year-old woman was expected. 
The death of the 60-year-old man took place during a medical procedure but it would be reasonable to expect his death due to the terrible prognosis of a ruptured AAA and his near-exsanguination on presentation. 
The death of the 70-year-old man would have been reportable if he were still in prison, on bail, a police informant, or in any way still engaged with the justice system. His death was not violent or accidental. 

The correct answer is reportable because the death certificate is not likely to be signed by the doctors if they cannot determine a cause of death. This should be reported promptly to the coroner. They might request that the body be sent to Melbourne ASAP after some more information, or they might send the police on their behalf to gather more information. In this case, her body would likely be sent for autopsy so a cause of death can be put on the death certificate.

Radicular leg pain in a single dermatomal distribution is more suggestive of single nerve root compression (see Symptomatic lumbar disc herniation).

The clinical course of symptomatic spinal canal stenosis is variable, and can be unpredictable, with flares and stable periods over time. Approximately 50% of patients remain clinically stable, while 25% deteriorate over time and the remaining 25% improve over time. Despite the common perception of a progressive course, patients with mild to moderately symptomatic spinal canal stenosis have a favourable outcome in 30 to 50% of cases.

Of the remaining options, congenital subglottic stenosis is rare and unlikely to present with constant daytime noisy breathing if it is mild - and if it were more severe than this there would likely be other manifestations. This leaves the congenital vascular ring, which fits with the symptoms described.

What is the most appropriate management?",FALSE,TRUE,Kat Zed***,General Practice(Year 4),Add low dose calcium channel blocker,"The Heart Foundation recommendations state that if target blood pressure is not achieved within 3 months of initiating a low dose first-line agent, adding a second low-dose agent is preferable to increasing the dose of the existing agent in order to maximise antihypertensive efficacy and minimise adverse effects. The combination of ACE-I and CCB is superior to ACE and diuretics or beta blocker and diuretics in terms of cardiovascular risk and mortality (see page 33 in the link below). 

Changing to an ARB would be appropriate if Harriet was experiencing side effects of the ACE-I. 

Investigating for an underlying cause is unlikely to yield any useful information - the most common cause of secondary hypertension in this age group is renal artery stenosis and so you would likely have observed a deterioration in renal function when treated with an ACE-I. Thyroid dysfunction is the other likely cause of secondary hypertension in this group but her thyroid function is normal.

Teriparatide is a sythetic form of human parathyroid hormone which stimulates osteoblast activity. 

Raloxifene is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) which exerts the positive oestrogen effects on bone including reducing resorption of bone and increasing bone mineral density. 

Strontium ranelate increases osteoblast precursor replication and collagen synthesis, and reduces bone resorption through altering the ultrastructure of osteoclasts.

This presentation is an example of which of the following diagnoses? ",FALSE,TRUE,Ben Paul***,Mental Health(Year 3),Malingering,"Malingering is the conscious production of signs and symptoms of medical illness with a conscious motivation. Usually this is to avoid something, gain an advantage or revenge. There is a tendency to fake common disorders with symptoms that are hard to refute e.g. headaches, anxiety, low back pain etc. In this question, the fact that these 'severe headaches' only occur when he is to present to court should lead you to consider this diagnosis, although a proper assessment of the patient would be needed to ensure no serious condition is missed. 

Conversion disorder is sensory (or motor) dysfunction in the absence of physical pathology. Usually occurs in females, appears suddenly and remits spontaneously. It can also occur in epidemics. This does not typically present with headaches in this nature. 

Hypochondriasis is the fear or belief that they have a specific disease. Present for 6 months, their preoccupation is there despite reassurance by doctors, and it affects their level of functioning. This is not a delusional disorder. 

Factitious disorder is the conscious production of signs and symptoms of medical illness with unconscious motivation. The objective is to assume the sick role. If the tests come back negative, they tend to become angry and accuse the doctors, threatening litigation. This is a reasonable differential for this question, however there is clear motivation to avoid the court case in this scenario. 

Subarachnoid haemorrhage would have to be considered in a patient with a severe headache. However, given the repeated episodes and no findings on examination and imaging, this is less likely.

Intraoperatively, he received 8 units of packed RBCs, and was transferred to ICU on a ventilator with an ETT in situ, initially with minimal oxygen requirements. Twenty-four hours later, his requirement for O2 has begun to increase. A CXR shows new bi-basal opacities.

The most likely diagnosis is: ",FALSE,TRUE,Ben Paul***,Anaesthetics/ICU(Year 4),Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"ARDS occurs in situations of severe illness and/or lung injury. It can be diagnosed using the Berlin definition of:
1. Acute   onset over 1 week or less
2. Bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary oedema on CXR or CT
3. PaO/FiO <300mmHg (40kPa) with a minimum PEEP of 5cm H2O
4. Not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload

Acute lung injury is an outdated term analogous to ARDS. Ventilator-associated pneumonia occurs in situations such as these (patients on ventilators with opacity on CXR), however the illness takes longer to develop than the scenario above. While TRALI presents similarly to the above patient (especially given his high volume of blood products received), by definition it must present within 6 hours of transfusion. Given the normal echocardiography result, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema can be effectively ruled out.
