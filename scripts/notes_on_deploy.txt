# From https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-20-04
# If you update your Django application, you can restart the Gunicorn process to pick up the changes by typing:
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
# If you change Gunicorn socket or service files, reload the daemon and restart the process by typing:
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn.socket gunicorn.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# If you change the Nginx server block configuration, test the configuration and then Nginx by typing:
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx
